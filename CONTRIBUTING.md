## Guidelines
To keep everything on track and make sure the README stays helpful, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Stay on Topic**:
   Only add explanations about basic to intermediate C++ concepts that can be shown using the console. We want this README to be a go-to resource for beginners, so keep your contributions focused on that.

2. **Use Reliable Sources**:
   If you use tools to help write, make sure to include a link to the tool you used. If you used chatGPT, ensure to provide the chat link as a reference. It's even better if you can find other trusted sources to back up what you've written. **(Reputable resources are prioritized over AI-generated content.)**

3. **Avoid Duplicates**:
   Before submitting issues or pull requests, please check to ensure that similar ones do not already exist. We want to keep things organized and avoid repeating ourselves.
   
4. **Meaningful Commits**:
   Write clear and descriptive commit messages as this helps everyone understand what's happening with the README.

Your contributions will make a big difference in helping others learn C++. Thanks for support!
